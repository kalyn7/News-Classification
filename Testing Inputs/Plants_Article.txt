The taxonomy of this plant is Lagerstroemia x 'Natchez.' As with many of the widely-grown crepe myrtle trees used in landscaping, it is a hybrid derived from crossing Lagerstroemia indica with Lagerstroemia fauriei. Although originally from Asia, Lagerstroemia is naturalized in the Southeastern U.S. 'Natchez' is the cultivar name.

Natchez crepe myrtles are deciduous shrubs or small trees.

The most commonly found Oriental poppy flowers are orange (for example, Prince of Orange), and the next most popular color is red (for example, Livermere).

But many cultivars exist, offering a variety of colors. Possible alternatives to orange and red include pink, purple, white, peach, and maroon. The blossom petals usually sport a dark blotch at their base. The large buds nod but raise their heads as the flowers unfurl. The big, thistle-like leaves are downy, deeply-lobed, and rich green in color, offering aesthetic value in their own right. The leaves are tightly packed. This is a clump-forming plant. Flower stems are stiff and hairy, making Oriental poppy a good cut flower. Overall plant height (when in bloom) is typically 3 feet. The pods that succeed the flowers also have an ornamental quality and are dried for crafts. But the above-ground growth dies back in summer, when the plant goes dormant.
