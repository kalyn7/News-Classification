Now Kogai says the U.S. resurgence will start in earnest in 2019 and kick into overdrive in 2021 when Mazda adds an all-new crossover designed for and built exclusively in the U.S.

Giving first details of the new nameplate in a Nov. 16 interview, Kogai said it has potential to be the brand's best-seller. He said it would slot into Mazda's three-vehicle crossover lineup without cannibalizing the CX-3, CX-5 and CX-9.

The vehicle will be produced starting in 2021 at the plant Mazda and Toyota plan to jointly build in the U.S.

Mazda will initially dedicate its entire capacity of 150,000 units there to the vehicle. For comparison, Mazda's best-selling nameplate, the CX-5, managed just 112,235 units in 2016.

"We have big expectations," Kogai said of the new utility entry. "This is our declaration that we are going to grow our business in the U.S."

Arriving in 2021, Mazda's new SUV is decidedly long term. But Kogai hopes for a hit by developing something uniquely tailored to U.S. needs.
Automobile brands are among the most iconic images of their respective countries. Lamborghini is essentially Italian, for example, while Volvo is inherently Swedish and Jaguar classically British.

Brand imagery may be the only thing about the automobile industry that globalization hasn’t changed, though. (For the record, Lamborghini is owned by Germany’s Volkswagen Group; Volvo Cars is owned by China’s Geely Holding Group; Jaguar’s parent company is India-based Tata motors.)

Today, automobile manufacturing is a politics-infused, border-spanning process in which risks are as apparent as rewards. I’ve covered the automobile industry for 11 years, including the last two at Reuters, and I have seen the impact globalization has had on the industry. Looking into the near future, here are three more areas where I expect it to have a major impact.
