Netflix will stream Love Per Square Foot worldwide which also marks the first time an Indian film will be produced exclusively for streaming. Coproduced by Still and Still Pictures, the title is slated to premiere in early 2018.

The film is described as a quirky romantic comedy about a young couple who enter a marriage of convenience to buy a flat in Mumbai. It will star Vicky Kaushal and debutant actress Angira Dhar in the lead with the project also marking the directorial debut of Anand Tiwari. The supporting cast includes veteran actresses Ratna Pathak and Supriya Pathak along with actor Raghuvir Yadav (whose credits include India’s Oscar entry Newton).

“How, where and when great stories are watched is changing every day,” said Screwvala adding, “Our younger audiences choose their mediums. We love to disrupt and innovate in this space and this is a first of its kind for South Asia.”
 
“We’re always looking for stories that bring joy to Netflix members, and Love Per Square Foot is a gem that we’re proud to have on the service,” said Netflix founder and CEO Reed Hastings. “RSVP is a visionary partner, and we want to continue working with them and the best of Bollywood to deliver compelling stories to consumers around the world.”

Netflix has been ramping up its Indian offerings by partnering with leading Bollywood entities such as superstar Shah Rukh Khan’s Red Chillies Entertainment with which it will coproduce spy thriller Bard of Blood. The video giant’s first Indian original series, Sacred Games, is currently in production which stars top actor Saif Ali Khan, codirected by Anurag Kashyap (Gangs of Wasseypur) and Vikramaditya Motwane.
